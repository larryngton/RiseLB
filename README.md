# RiseLB

Recreation of the Rise Minecraft client user interface in LiquidBounce using Svelte.

# Overview

RiseLB is an open-source project that aims to recreate the Rise Minecraft client user interface in LiquidBounce, a popular Minecraft client, using Svelte, a lightweight and powerful JavaScript framework.

# Features

* **Rise-inspired User Interface**: RiseLB brings the iconic Rise UI to LiquidBounce, providing a familiar and intuitive experience for Rise users.
* **Customizable**: RiseLB is built using Svelte, making it easy to customize and extend the UI to suit your needs with little code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* LiquidBounce installed on your system
* Node.js and npm installed on your system

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/liquidsquid1/RiseLB.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build and run: `npm run build`, and copy the "dist" folder created into your LiquidBounce themes directory.

### Want a different colour?

Before you do step 3, simply change `src\colors.scss` to change the accent colour. This will affect the entire user interface.
